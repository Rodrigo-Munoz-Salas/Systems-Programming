# THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY IN MASTER NOW

I might be tight on time so I'll put the most important projects and class activities

# FOLDERS WILL BE LABELED BASED ON THEIR CONTENTS
 - The projects folder will include PA2
 - Create a new folder inside that one and add the code you wrote for your PA2
 - It now also includes a sample code

 - The class activity folder will contain the later class activities that would be more useful
 - Each CA will be inside that folder and will have a name describing what the code does
